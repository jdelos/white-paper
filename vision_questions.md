# CalÃ§otada Protocol Vision Questions

## Your First Answer

**Valuation calculation methods** -> I am using a Discounted Cash Flows as industry standard for early startups. This is my proposal, the difference here is that we can embed a mechanism that provides buy backs on the current company performance based on these valuations. This sets a standard for the future large investments and also provide early liquidity.

## On Composability

### 1. What specific components should be standardized?

- Valuation calculation methods? [ANSWERED: DCF-based valuations]
- Buyback mechanisms?
  The buy bak meachanims are defined by DCF valuations where the extnal parmaetes like industry multplier and WACC should come from and oracle base on our current performances.

Based on this valutions I provide early exits with buy backs.
you can finde them in the ./Tokenomics RMSC.ods file.

The buys backs are defined buy a SAFE + I (interest model) based on the EPOS contract.
Valuation = (1+Interest)^year/(1-Discount)
Tk_ROI = MAX( Valuation, Valuation/ValuationCap)
This ROI multiplier is abased on the AVRG_RMSC mint price
TK_BUY_BACK_PRICE = TK_ROI \* Price_at_mint_avg

  Could evolve in a standard could evolve in a dedicated network, for PEG coins.

## TDB with the onboarding team.

## On Oracle Integration
