\section{Technical Implementation}

\subsection{Smart Contract Architecture}

The Calçotada Protocol consists of four core smart contracts deployed on Polygon:

\textbf{1. CalcotCoin.sol (ERC721):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manages NFT issuance and ownership
    \item Implements linear pricing mechanism
    \item Handles treasury pre-allocation
    \item Integrates with orchestrator for minting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Romesco.sol (ERC20):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implements capped token supply (5M RMSC)
    \item Provides ERC1363 and Permit extensions
    \item Controlled minting via orchestrator only
    \item Pausable for emergency situations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Calcotada.sol (Orchestrator):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coordinates all protocol interactions
    \item Implements bonding curve pricing
    \item Manages dual-minting mechanism
    \item Handles fee collection and treasury forwarding
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. NormalizeToEuro.sol (Oracle):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrates Chainlink price feeds
    \item Provides EUR/POL/ETH conversions
    \item Ensures accurate multi-currency pricing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Considerations}

\textbf{Access Control:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Owner-controlled administrative functions
    \item Orchestrator pattern for inter-contract calls
    \item No external minting access on token contracts
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Safety Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ReentrancyGuard on all payment functions
    \item Pausable functionality for emergency response
    \item Overflow protection via Solidity 0.8.28
    \item Battle-tested OpenZeppelin libraries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gas Optimization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Batch minting reduces per-NFT gas costs
    \item Q16.16 arithmetic minimizes computational overhead
    \item Efficient storage patterns in bonding curve
    \item Optimized loops with unchecked arithmetic where safe
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol Composability}

The Calçotada Protocol exposes several public and payable functions that enhance composability with other DeFi protocols:

\textbf{Public Query Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{previewPurchaseCost}: Returns prices in POL for RMSC purchases
    \item \texttt{previewPurchaseCostEur}: Returns prices in EUR for RMSC purchases
    \item \texttt{getPriceBatchNFT}: Provides pricing for NFT batches in both POL and EUR
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Payable Minting Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{calcotCoinPublicMint}: Allows public minting of NFTs with POL payment
    \item \texttt{publicRmscMint}: Enables direct RMSC token purchases (not yet exposed in UI)
\end{itemize}

These functions allow external protocols and smart contracts to integrate with the Calçotada ecosystem, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automated trading strategies based on real-time pricing
    \item Integration with DEX aggregators for optimal routing
    \item Building of derivative products on top of RMSC tokens
    \item Creation of vaults and yield strategies
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Composability Foundation}

The Calçotada Protocol aims to establish standardized components that any startup can use to create their own equity-pegged tokens:

\textbf{Standardized Valuation Methods:}
We propose using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models as the industry standard for early-stage startup valuations. Unlike traditional approaches, our innovation embeds buyback mechanisms directly tied to current company performance. This creates a new standard where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Valuations are calculated transparently on-chain
    \item External parameters (industry multipliers, WACC) are provided by oracles
    \item Buybacks are triggered automatically based on performance milestones
    \item Early liquidity is provided through a SAFE + Interest model
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Projected Returns (2027-2032):}
Based on our DCF models for The Calçotada Company:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pessimistic scenario: 2.1x return by 2031
    \item Standard scenario: 2.8x return by 2031
    \item Optimistic scenario: 5.5x return by 2031
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On-Chain Accountancy Revolution}

Current accounting depends on centralized bank integrations and proprietary software. We envision:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Immutable, auditable financial records on-chain
    \item Access to real-time Free Cash Flow data
    \item New ecosystem of accountancy DApps
    \item Smart contract auditors guaranteeing transparency
    \item Integration with privacy solutions (e.g., Hyperledger) for competitive data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capturing the Meme Coin Market}

The crypto community investing in meme coins represents untapped potential for meaningful investments:

\textbf{What PEG Coins Offer:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item High risk/reward profile similar to meme coins
    \item 20\% early rewards for liquidity providers
    \item Long-term returns ranging from 2x to 5.5x
    \item Real utility backing token value
    \item Community engagement through governance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Liquidity Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Early liquidity pools with tax mechanisms for flippers
    \item Rewards for long-term believers
    \item Transition from speculation to value creation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building Trust Through Standards}

The protocol addresses fundamental trust barriers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Valuation Trust:} Pre-defined DCF models with oracle-provided parameters
    \item \textbf{Buyback Trust:} Smart contract execution with public reserves
    \item \textbf{Process Trust:} Deterministic mathematical expressions
    \item \textbf{Access Trust:} Guaranteed participation in seed capital opportunities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target Audience and Growth}

\textbf{Primary Targets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Retail investors currently in meme coins seeking real utility
    \item Young professionals interested in startup investing
    \item International investors excluded from traditional VC
    \item Non-accredited investors seeking early-stage opportunities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Growth Mechanisms:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Referral system (5 RMSC per new user)
    \item Education initiatives on equity pegs
    \item Community-driven protocol development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Five-Year Success Metrics}

By 2029, success means:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Calçotada Company operating at full scale in Europe
    \item 3 patents published on protocol innovations
    \item Profitable operations from year 3
    \item Active buyback program demonstrating model viability
    \item RMSC accepted as collateral in major DeFi protocols
    \item Establishment of the "Calçotada Standard" for equity pegs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Development Roadmap}

The current deployment represents a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to validate market interest and establish the foundational infrastructure. The roadmap prioritizes sustainable growth and community building over rapid feature deployment.

\textbf{Whitepaper Publication and Protocol Launch:}
This whitepaper will be released concurrently with the public announcement of the Calçotada Protocol, marking the official start of Phase 1.

    \item Establish Calçotada Protocol as standard for tokenized venture funding
\end{itemize}


Future research will explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimal bonding curve parameters for different funding stages
    \item Integration of zero-knowledge proofs for private financial data
    \item Cross-chain implementations for broader accessibility
    \item Regulatory compliance frameworks for security token standards
\end{itemize}

The Calçotada Protocol MVP demonstrates the technical feasibility of tokenized venture funding while prioritizing community validation and sustainable growth. By starting with a focused Genesis collection of 333 NFTs, the protocol seeks to validate market interest, build a dedicated team, and establish fundamental standards before expanding to its full vision. This measured approach ensures that when the protocol scales to support The Calçotada Company's operations and eventual buybacks, it will do so with proven mechanics, community trust, and a clear path to delivering value to all stakeholders. The journey from MVP to full protocol implementation represents not just a technical roadmap, but a new model for inclusive, transparent venture capital.
